Bozym (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts. Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital. Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky me-diastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Dr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma. Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient’s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.

On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and “weird.” A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opi-ates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopha-ryngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intra-ventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Brooks P. Applewhite: Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cere-brovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Dr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epi-leptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or sub-acute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. Dr. Karandinos: The patient’s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Thiamine was administered intravenously. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Mauney (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient’s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital. In the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptospo-ridium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. During the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient’s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts. The patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipi-demia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash. The white-cell count was 10,690 per microli-ter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenos-copy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed. Dr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Fig. 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation — characterized by erythema and friability — was found in the car-dia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Fig. 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation. When the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Fig. 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonob-structing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Fig. 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation. Dr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed a central filling defect in the distal right pulmonary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism (Fig. 2E). There was also a large right pleural effusion. Dr. Mauney: A diagnostic test was performed.

Schaefer: A 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol and opioid use was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of abnormal results on liver testing. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase on routine testing performed by his primary care physician. At that time, he reported that testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies had been positive in the past. The HCV RNA level was undetectable; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cessation of alcohol use was advised. Two years before the current presentation, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase had decreased; additional laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1. Seven months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of pain and swelling in the left wrist that had lasted for 3 weeks. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of pred-nisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved. Six months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3°C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopa-thy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation. Two weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Four months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Fig. 1A). Spleno-megaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Fig. 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Fig. 1D). Dr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 μmol per liter (169 μg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 μmol per liter [19 to 102 μg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radio-graph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardio-gram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge. One month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine–nalox-one. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine–naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister. On examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochon-drial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120.

However, given the mild nature of these findings, correlation with clinical findings is necessary to establish a diagnosis of nodular regenerative hyperplasia. The portal tracts were variably expanded and contained moderate lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. 2A). These inflammatory cells trickled outward into the limiting plate of hepatocytes, but there was no associated hepatocyte damage that would be suggestive of interface activity. Trichrome staining highlighted the expanded portal tracts but did not show definitive portal–portal bridging (Fig. 2B). The portal tracts were ductopenic, with many portal tracts missing a native bile duct that corresponded to the present artery and vein (Fig. 2C). Several of these portal tracts had a prominent ductular reaction (Fig. 2D). These findings were highlighted on immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 7 (Fig. 2E) and cytokeratin 19. Copper staining was positive for copper accumulation in periportal hepatocytes (Fig. 2F). Taken together, the overall morphologic findings are diagnostic of a chronic cholestatic process. There were no florid duct lesions, which would be diagnostic of primary biliary cholangi-tis. However, the histologic evidence of chronic cholangiopathy, together with the patient’s clinical presentation and laboratory findings, is consistent with a diagnosis of primary biliary chol-angitis. The presence of ductular proliferation and ductopenia in the absence of established fibrotic bridging is consistent with stage 2 of 4 primary biliary cholangitis, on the basis of the Scheuer staging system.21 There was no definitive histologic evidence of chronic HCV infection, alcoholic cirrhosis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Croughan (Medicine): A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgias, and one previous episode of vomiting. Nine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. While the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission. Two days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0°C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged.
